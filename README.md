==========
IRC bot in Ruby centered around Minecraft related functionality. Also programming exercise

github: https://github.com/heydabop/silverfish

Configuration
------------
Most (not all :\ )settings that need to be changed are constants defined in config.rb. Some constants are defined in pass.rb and mcrcon.rb, which I don't commit to my repository. These constants are commented out in config.rb.

Running
-------
    ruby /path/to/main.rb

Support
-------
Issues on github. I make no promises.
